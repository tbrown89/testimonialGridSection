                            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                        <p class="testimonial-body light">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                            I’ve
                            been
                            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                            I
                            signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                            thereafter.
                            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                            course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

                            work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made

                            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the
                            world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You
                            will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
                            people.”</p>

                        <p class="testimonial-body dark">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                            code. I
                            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I
                            was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                            about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                            was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                            have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
